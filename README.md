# Benchmarking GWAS prioritization methods

## Description

## Installation
* * *

### Single install
The easiest way to install all the required packages is via conda. How to install conda on your system can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

To create a new environment which contains all the required packages plus the right version run the following code:

```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new environment named `benchmark-gwas-prio` which can be used to run this repository.

> NOTE: the environment.yml is located in the install/ directory [here](install/environment.yml).

### Multiple installs
An other option is to install each package seperately, either with conda or pip.

conda:
```bash
  conda install <PACKAGE>=<VERSION>
```

pip
```bash
  pip install <PACKAGE>==<VERSION>
```

> NOTE: make sure to use the correct versions, which are listed [here](#packages).
